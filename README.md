# Unsteady_Natural_Convection_In_A_Cavity
This code is simulating unsteady natural convection in a cavity. It is solving for the vorticity, streamfunction, and temperature fields using a finite difference method. The problem is two-dimensional and has symmetric boundary conditions except for the left and right walls, which have fixed temperatures.
